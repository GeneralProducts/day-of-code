        <h2>Our Pledge</h2>
        <p>
          In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as project creators and hosts, sponsors, delegates and coaches (the participants) pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Our Standards
        </h2>
        <p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="list-item">Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
          <li class="list-item">Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>

          <li class="list-item">The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
          <li class="list-item">Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
          <li class="list-item">Public or private harassment</li>
          <li class="list-item">Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>

          <li class="list-item">Damaging or misusing the physical space or equipment</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Project leadership is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>Project leadership have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any participant for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, during the workshop, in online forums regarding the workshop, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project leadership.
        </p>

        <h2>Enforcement</h2>
        <p>
          Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at info@consonance.app or in person or via mobile to Sara O'Connor on the day of the workshop. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Hosts</h2>
        <p>
          We are being hosted by Hachette UK, who are providing physical space and refreshments/food for all attendees. As it is a
          normal working day with over a thousand people working in Carmelite House, we need to be mindful of the other users of
          the building:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="list-item">Please keep to the workshop and facilities areas or stay with your host, and don’t wander around the building: you need
          a security pass to get through many doors and finding lost or stuck participants may keep us from coding.</li>
          <li class="list-item">If you’re in public areas, please be aware of your surroundings and keep noise levels down.</li>
          <li class="list-item">Participants will be briefed on fire and other safety procedures at the start of the day and, in the unlikely event of
          an incident, participants should follow all instructions from their hosts or Hachette staff.</li>
          <li class="list-item">There are no visitor cycle storage facilities, so if you are coming by bicycle please allow sufficient time to use
          public cycle racks in the surrounding area.</li>
          <li class="list-item">Guest Wi-Fi will be available, but we expect visitors to observe the same guidelines as Hachette’s people regarding
          appropriate network usage. Traffic may be monitored for security purposes.</li>
          <li class="list-item">Smoking, including the use of electronic cigarettes, is strictly prohibited throughout the building, including the roof
          terrace and entranceways.</li>
          <li class="list-item">Any breach of these guidelines will be dealt with through the workshop Code of Conduct and/or, in the case of a
          serious/safety breach, by Hachette asking individuals to leave.</li>
        </ul>
