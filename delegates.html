        <strong>Day of Code</strong> is an inspirational and hands-on day. By the end you will have built a working website, heard from inspirational people at the intersection of publishing and technology, and be provided with the (free) tools and inspiration to carry on coding. Here's what the day looks like: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="time">09.00</span> - Introductory talks from our key sponsors, Hachette, FutureBook and Consonance, at Hachette's building on the Embankment in London
      </p>
      <p><span class="time">09.15</span> - Get into groups</p>
      <p><span class="time">09.30</span>  - Coaches take groups to pre-designated meeting rooms. Delegates start to build their own website on their own laptop</p>
      <p><span class="time">12.30 </span> - Basement - lightning talks while lunching</p>
      <p><span class="time">13.30</span>  - Back to meeting rooms to finish up the websites</p>
      <p><span class="time">16.30</span>  - Basement - wrap up & goodbye</p>
      <p><span class="time">Finish by 17.00</p>
      <p>All the materials you'll use on the day will be published on this website nearer the time, and available after the event, too.</p>
