        <strong>Day of Code</strong> is a hands-on day. By the end you will have built a working website, heard from inspirational people at the intersection of publishing and technology, and be provided with the (free) tools and inspiration to carry on coding. Here's what the day looks like:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="time">08.45 </span>Arrive at Hachette's building on London's Embankment. Grab swag and t-shirts: purple for coaches, white for delegates
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="time">09.00 </span>Introductory talks
      </p>
      <p><span class="time">09.20 </span>Get into groups</p>
      <p><span class="time">09.30 </span>Coaches take groups to pre-designated meeting rooms. Delegates start to build their own website on their own laptop</p>
      <p><span class="time">12.30 </span>Basement for lightning talks while lunching</p>
      <p><span class="time">13.30 </span>Back to meeting rooms to finish up the websites</p>
      <p><span class="time">16.30 </span>Basement, to wrap up & goodbye</p>
      <p><span class="time">17.00 </span>Finish</p>
      <p>
        All the materials you'll use on the day will be published on this website nearer the time, and available after the event, too.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>Do I need my own computer?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes. You'll need a computer that you can install software on. It can be OS X or Windows. This is so you can continue developing after the event.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Will I have to do some set up in advance?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes. There will be clear instructions on how to set up your machine and a pre-event online help session if you get stuck. If you get really stuck, we can help on arrival, but you'll be able to get through much more if you're ready to go on the day.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Do I have to stay for the whole day?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes. With such a limited number of places, we need everyone to commit to the full day.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Do I have to agree to a code of conduct in order to participate?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes. And you should read it here: <a href="coc">Code of Conduct</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Will I be able to choose books that I work with on my website?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes, to an extent. Nielsen will be providing recent data from participating publishers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Is the venue accessible?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes. There is a ramp up to the external entrance and elevators to the floors we will be using.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Can the lunch cater for my dietary needs?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes. There will be a survey sent out beforehand to gather that information. Everyone should bring their own snacks.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Will I really build a book website in a day?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes. And it will look like this one: <a href="https://www.snowbooks.com/portfolio">snowbooks.com</a>.
