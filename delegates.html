        <strong>Day of Code</strong> is a hands-on day. By the end you will have built a working website, heard from inspirational people at the intersection of publishing and technology, and be provided with the (free) tools and inspiration to carry on coding. Here's what the day looks like:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="time">08.45 </span>Arrive at Hachette's building on London's Embankment. Grab swag and t-shirts: purple for coaches, white for delegates
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="time">09.00 </span>Introductory talks
      </p>
      <p><span class="time">09.20 </span>Get into groups</p>
      <p><span class="time">09.30 </span>Coaches take groups to pre-designated meeting rooms. Delegates start to build their own website on their own laptop</p>
      <p><span class="time">12.30 </span>Basement for lightning talks while lunching</p>
      <p><span class="time">13.30 </span>Back to meeting rooms to finish up the websites</p>
      <p><span class="time">16.30 </span>Basement, to wrap up & goodbye</p>
      <p><span class="time">17.00 </span>Finish</p>
      <p>
        All the materials you'll use on the day will be published on this website nearer the time, and available after the event, too.
