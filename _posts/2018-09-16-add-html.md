  This article tells you what HTML to add to your web page.
</p>

Earlier, you double clicked on the _index.html_ filename in your text editor's sidebar, which opened the file. Go to that file now. It looks like this:

![The index.html page](/assets/images/index.png)

## Add some content

You're going to replace the contents of the `<body>` tag with some new content, then you'll save the file, either by choosing **File > Save** or pressing **cmd+s** (Mac) or **ctrl+s** (Windows).

> <span class="content__learn-more">Save your work!</span>
> * You can see if a file needs to be saved because there is a dot in the filename tab in your text editor. Get into the habit of looking for the dot. If there's a dot, your file isn't saved!
> * You don't save work on the Command line. Commands are executed when you press **enter**.

Copy all the following text, and paste it in between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags, in _index.html_. Replace the words "It's worked", but keep the `<body>` and `</body>` tags:

{% highlight html %}
<header class="primary-header">
  <h1>Silver Oak Press</h1>
  <aside>New fiction, discovered</aside>
</header>
<section>
  <h2>Our wonderful books</h2>
  <p>
    Silver Oak Press is an [imaginary] award-winning independent publisher of outstanding new fiction [invented for the purpose of showcasing the FutureBook <a href="https://2019.dayofcode.co.uk">2019 Day of Code.</a>]

So now your _index.html_ file should look like this:

![The index.html page with its edits](assets/images/edited-index.png)

Take the time to indent your HTML until it looks like the screenshot. It won't affect your browser's ability to process the HTML, but it will keep your code neat and organised, and help you see the nesting is correct. Save the file.

> <span class="content__learn-more">Seriously: save your work!</span>
* Every time you change a file, save it. Try to build up the reflex of automatically pressing **cmd+s** (Mac) or **ctrl+s** (Windows). You don’t have to save command line commands: they run when you press ‘enter’. Remember: look for the dot in your text editor's filename tab. If you think something "hasn't worked", half the time it's because the file isn't saved.

Refresh your browser page. Your browser looks like this:

![The index page with some content added](assets/images/index-content.png)

> <span class="content__learn-more">Troubleshoot<span>
* If you get any sort of "not found" error, did you move your code folder's location on your laptop, or rename it after starting the server? If so, restart your server, and refresh the browser page.
* If the content of the page stays the same, look at the server log in your Terminal or Command prompt. If you have an old, not-powerful machine, it may take some time for the files to regenerate. Sit tight and when you see **regenerating index.html... done in xx seconds**, refresh the browser again.

OK: you've added some content to your web page, but it's not looking very pretty. That's because HTML provides structure but CSS provides styling, and you've not added any CSS yet.

Moreover, your content has some problems. You have added some links, which don't go anywhere yet. Click on the link to "View all our books" and you get this:

![A broken link page](assets/images/broken-link.png)

You will fix this in the next article. You also have a broken image link which you'll fix now.

## Fix the image link

Line 15 in your _index.html_ file looks like this:

{% highlight html %}
<img class="cover--home" src="" alt="Fake book cover for the imaginary Silver Oak Press" />
{% endhighlight %}

`img` is an HTML tag that has a `src` attribute. `img` is short for **Image** and `src` is short for **Source**. This code says that the source of the image is blank – it's an empty string `""`, which is why you get the missing image icon on your webpage.

You're going to fix this broken image reference. Replace the line:

{% highlight html %}
<img class="cover--home" src="" alt="Fake book cover for the imaginary Silver Oak Press" />
{% endhighlight %}

with a reference to an image file that does exist in your "images" folder: the file called **home_img.jpg**.

{% highlight html %}
<img class="cover--home" src="/images/home_img.jpg" alt="Fake book cover for the imaginary Silver Oak Press" />
{% endhighlight %}

Save the file, and refresh your browser. Great: your broken image link is fixed.

## Do more later

* After the Day of Code (or if you have finished working through this page early), update the text and image in your index page to match your real publishing company. Here's what mine looks like:

![Snowbooks data in place - the text editor view](assets/images/snowbooks1.png)
![Snowbooks data and images in place - the browser view](assets/images/snowbooks2.png)

Next, you're going to add another HTML page to fix the broken link.

## What you’ve learned

* HTML is a mark up language which you use to write a web page.
* Browsers display HTML.
* HTML is not responsible for styling – only structure.
* Some HTML tags create links, to other pages and to images.
