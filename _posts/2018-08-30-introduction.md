  Today you're going to get some programming experience, and leave having built a real website. This article explains the plan for the day.
</p>

## Scope of the day

Today is a chance for you to roll up your sleeves and write real, working, book-trade-specific code.

You won't become a programmer in a day, although all journeys start with a single step, and today might be the first of many days where you cajole a computer into doing what you want, using code. Like chess, you can learn the syntax of code fairly quickly, but it'll take a lifetime to perfect. That, to be honest, is the fun of it.

Today, you'll discover that modern programming has more parallels with storytelling than maths; that a certain facility with language and a natural attention to detail – skills found in any publishing professional – is arguably more important than a technical mind. You will realise that your existing knowledge of the ins and outs of your particular bit of publishing (your "domain knowledge") are both more difficult and harder to acquire than programming skills, and a critical component of writing software. In other words, you'll learn that you have a distinct advantage in writing publishing software over dedicated software developers.
