## Set up your environment

You’ll need somewhere to type your code and run a server,
and that’s Glitch, the IDE you were introduced to earlier.
You’ll need a Glitch account to use their services.

We recommend the latest version of Chrome as a browser.

## File structure
Expand the views folders. These are the files that make up
your app. At the moment there’s not much code in them:
you’re going to be guided through the process today to turn
this skeleton of files into a dynamic web app.
The most important files for today are in the views folder
(or directory) and the one called site.rb. The .rb is a file
suffix which means it is a Ruby file: the computer will expect
to find Ruby code in it. The files in views are where you will
write HTML and later embed some Ruby code to make your
app dynamic.

## The command line
At the bottom of the page you have the command line. It’s the
same as what you’d find if you’ve ever opened the Terminal
on your Mac, or the Command Prompt on Windows. You can
enter commands here which the computer will obey. Using
the command line is often a lot quicker and more reliable
than using the graphical user interface of your machine.

You’re going to set up your project so it’s got everything it
needs to run its code.

TODO: start the server

There’s a fair amount of computerese in there, but you
can pick out some bits of sense. We’re using version 2.5.5
of Ruby, and we’re using something called Jekyll.

In a new browser window, go to the URL you are given
and you’ll see a page that looks something like this:

## What you’ve learned

* You can use interactive development environments such
as Glitch to save you having to install lots of programs
directly on your own computer.
* An IDE such as Glitch contains a file directory, a
pane to edit your code in, and a command line that
you can write commands in, and run a server from.
