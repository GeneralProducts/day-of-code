  This article tells you how to create another web page.
</p>

Your index page contains links to another page, but those links are currently broken. Clicking on them in your browser takes you to an error message:

You will fix this by adding another html file to your website repo.

## Add a new HTML file

In your repo, click to add a new file and call it `portfolio.html`.

Type some words in, such as "here's my portfolio page", and save the file.

Go back to your browser and try the link again. This time, your new page gets served:

## Add some content

Let's replace your placeholder text with some real HTML. Copy and paste the following in to the file:

{% highlight html %}
  <!doctype html>
  <html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
      <div class="header__background">
        <h1>
          Portfolio
          <span class="header__subtitle">Incredible stories, published with love</span>
        </h1>
      </div>
      <section class="container__portfolio">
        Book list goes here
      </section>
    </body>
  </html>
{% endhighlight %}

Now you have another page with some content.

But we have three clear problems.

* These pages are still unstyled. We will have to add some CSS to make them look better.
* There is duplication of code between the index and the portfolio pages. Duplication makes code more difficult to maintain so we'd be better off creating some code that can be shared by both pages.
* There are no books listed yet on our portfolio page.

We'll solve each of these problems today, and we'll tackle the first one next by adding some style information using CSS.

## What youâ€™ve learned

* HTML pages can link to each other using the `<a>` HTML tag.
* Websites are a collection of HTML pages.
