  Building on your knowledge of templating, this article adds more shared code to your template.
</p>

Let's add some navigation links that will appear on every page. Now you have a template, you only have to change shared code in one place.

## Add a reference to navigation links to your template

Open _layouts/default.html_. Add the following line directly under the opening `<body>` tag:

{% highlight html %}
  {% raw %}{% include navigation.html %}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This makes the full file look like this:

{% highlight html %}
  <!doctype html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css">
      <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Amiri&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
      <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Noto+Sans:400,700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body>
      {% raw %}{% include navigation.html %}{% endraw %}
      {% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}
    </body>
  </html>
{% endhighlight %}


Refresh the index page in your browser, because the index page uses the default template. You might expect the page to show some navigation links. Hang on: why hasn't anything changed?

## Debug the missing reference

To debug this problem, let's look at the server log. Look at your Terminal, where your server log has been running all this time. There is a big red error message:

If you pick through those words, shouty-red and off-putting though they are, they are actually very descriptive and tell you that you've failed to include a file:

{% highlight term %}
  Liquid Exception: Could not locate the included file 'navigation.html'
{% endhighlight %}

So you'll add that file now.

## Add the missing file

Add a folder called __includes_, and a file called _navigation.html_ within that. The __includes_ folder must be at the same level as other folders that start with an underscore, such as __layouts_.

Paste the following code in to it, and save the file.

{% highlight html %}
  <nav>
    <ul class="nav-item-container ">
      <li class="nav-item"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
      <li class="nav-item"><a href="/portfolio/">Books</a></li>
      <li class="nav-item"><a href="/about/">About</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
{% endhighlight %}

Refresh the browser: you'll see your new nav links. And now you can more easily get around your website: click the "Books" link on your web page.

## What youâ€™ve learned

* Once you have templates set up, there are fewer places where you have to maintain code.

## Stretch goals

* It's best for users if link labels match the words found at their destination. Amend the word "Books" to "Portfolio", by editing the _navigation.html_ file.
* Make the "About" link work, in the same way you added the portfolio page.
* Add in a footer section, using the following code as a starting point:

{% highlight html %}
  <!-- _layouts/default.html -->
  <body>
    {% raw %}{% include navigation.html %}{% endraw %}
    {% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}
    {% raw %}{% include footer.html %}{% endraw %}
  </body>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<footer>
