## The tools of our trade
There are lots of different programming languages, and
more are being created all the time. They are often very
specialised. COBOL was designed to make it easy to solve
business problems. FORTRAN was, and still is, used to write
high performance scientific programs.
In this course you’ll be using four programming languages:

* HTML (express information)
* CSS (style information)
* Ruby (dynamically generate information)
* Liquid (load dynamic information into HTML)

One of the most interesting and heartwarming features
of the modern programming world is the open source
movement. We build on the shoulders of giants, reusing
code that the community have built, tested and released for
use at no charge. These are not hobbyist resources: open
source has the benefit of being more thoroughly and widely
tested than closed, proprietary software.
Today, we will be using an open source resource called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. 

## HTML
HTML is the language of the web. Every single website
you’ve ever been on is made from HTML, and ePubs are
made from it, too. It is a markup language for describing web
pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

## CSS
CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the
presentation of a document written in a markup language,
such as HTML. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

## Ruby
Ruby has been around for about 20 years. Ruby became
very popular as a language for developing web applications,
which are websites that users can interact with, about ten
years ago, after the release of a web application framework
written in Ruby, called Ruby on Rails.
The aim of Ruby on Rails was to make it very easy
to develop web applications by hiding nearly all of the
complexity from the developer. Today we’ll be using an even more simple
framework than Rails, to quickly create a website
in Ruby with minimal effort. Our publishing management
system, [Consonance](https://consonance.app), is written in Ruby on Rails.

## Liquid
Liquid is an open-source template language created by Shopify and written in Ruby. 
It is used to load dynamic content onto websites.


## Glitch
When a web application has been written, it used to be the
case that you then had to buy or rent a server connected to
the internet, and then install and maintain all of the required
software and security configurations. However, another
major recent change has been a profusion in companies,
such as Amazon and Google, offering rental of their own
computers for running code and managing applications.
Some companies, such as Netflix, run their businesses
entirely on rented servers, accessible over the internet in
the cloud. And still more companies provide management
layers on top of these services that hide their complexity
from you, making it even easier to run your own application,
and because they have a huge customer base of very similar
systems, they can do so extremely cheaply.

Until very recently this still left you with the problem of
setting up your own computer to develop your application,
and this has often been a rather trying business. In the past
few years, hosted systems have come to market that allow
you to develop your code on remote servers, so you don’t
even need to have a sophisticated and complex development
environment on your own desktop or laptop computers.

Today you will be using an IDE called Glitch to
develop our code. IDE stands for Interactive Development
Environment. The nice thing about that is that you will be
able to access the work you do today from any computer via
a browser -- so you can keep on learning and coding. You
won’t learn to program in one day. Today could be the start
of the most rewarding journey of your life -- but it’ll be a long 
journey. Using an IDE such as Glitch will set you up for
easy collaboration and the ability to program anywhere.

## Publisher Website
Today you are going to write a website which
uses book data you already have and displays the results on
a series of web pages. You’ll be using all the technologies described
previously. So let’s get started!

## What you’ve learned
* You tell computers what to do by using a programming
language.
* You can use more than one programming language at a
time
* There are lots of different sorts of programming languages,
each written with a particular speciality in mind.
* Learning to program takes time. Using a good development
environment can help you get set up quickly so you can
focus on programming, not installing software.
