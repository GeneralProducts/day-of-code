  You’ll use different software to type your code, run your code, and view what your code does. This article introduces the set-up actions you must do, before the Day of Code, on the laptop you'll bring with you on the day.

> Installation is the most annoying and baffling aspect of programming. If you find the following difficult, you are not alone. Follow the instructions relevant to your laptop, in this and the following articles in this "Before the Day of Code" section. Following these instructions will take at least half an hour, and maybe more, so you MUST find some time to do it before the Day of Code. We won't have time on the day.

## Command line

The command line is where you will run your code. On the Mac, the command line is called the [Terminal](glossary#terminal). On Windows, it's called the [Command Prompt](glossary#command-prompt). Either way, it is the means by which you can type instructions to your computer. You don't need to install anything: they are already on your computer.

Regardless of whether you are on Mac or Windows, you will enter commands at the command line which the computer will obey. Using the command line is often a lot quicker and more reliable than using the graphical user interface of your machine: Finder on Mac or File Explorer on Windows.

## Install a text editor to edit code files
We recommend the text editor Atom because it is free. If you have a strong preference of text editor, you are welcome to use another.

[Download Atom and install it](https://atom.io/)

## Browser

A browser is where you will view what your code does. We recommend the latest version of Chrome or Firefox.

Go to [Update my browser](https://updatemybrowser.org/) and check you are using the latest version of your preferred browser. We recommend Chrome, and definitely not Internet Explorer.

## Version control and backup

As well as saving your code on your computer, you are going to use a webservice called GitHub to store a copy of your code. Create a free account on GitHub. GitHub is where most programmers save and share their code, as well as having it on their computers.

Go to [Github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account. Make sure you use a username and password that you will be able to recall on the Day of Code.

* [Git for writers](https://medium.com/@sayhellotovanessa/git-for-writers-write-fiction-like-a-good-programmer-ea6f0309a69a) – Aside from programming, all publishers and authors should use git, since we have so many changing documents. Learning git, and sharing how to use it with your authors, means an end to calls from authors that their hard drive is corrupted and the manuscript changes are lost forever.


## What you’ve learned

* Software is needed to make software, and it's called the "development environment"
* Thanks to [RailsGirls](http://guides.railsgirls.com/install) for providing the instructions that ours are heavily based on.
