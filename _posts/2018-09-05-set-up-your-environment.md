  You’ll use different software to type your code, run your code, and view what your code does. This article walks through the set up actions you must do before the Day of Code.
</p>

## Installation

Follow the instructions [here](http://installrails.com/) to set up Ruby and Rails on your computer, alongside some other tools you'll need. We're not using Rails today, but this will leave your computer ready for when you want to continue on your programming adventure.

Following these instructions will take at least half an hour, and maybe more, so find some time to do it before the Day of Code.

## Text editor

This is where you will type your code. The installation instructions prompt you to download Sublime. If you prefer another text editor such as VS Code or Atom, download that to your computer.

## Command line

This is where you will run your code. On the Mac, the command line is called the Terminal. On Windows, it's called the Command Prompt. Either way, it is the means by which you can type instructions to your computer.

You don't need to install anything: these apps ship with your computer and the installation instructions introduce you to them.

Regardless of whether you are on Mac or Windows, you will enter commands at the command line which the computer will obey. Using the command line is often a lot quicker and more reliable than using the graphical user interface of your machine.

## Browser

This is where you will view what your code does. We recommend the latest version of Chrome or Firefox.

Go to [Update my browser](https://updatemybrowser.org/) and check you are using the latest version of your preferred browser. Do not use Edge or Internet Explorer: IE in particular is notoriously non-standard.

## Version control and backup

As well as saving your code on your computer, you are going to use GitHub to store a copy of your code. You have installed Git using the installation instructions above, but now you are going to also create a free account on a service called GitHub. GitHub is where most programmers globally keep their code.

Go to [Github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account. Make sure you use a username and password that you will be able to recall on the Day of Code.

tracking & collaboration with version control!
* [Git for writers](https://medium.com/@sayhellotovanessa/git-for-writers-write-fiction-like-a-good-programmer-ea6f0309a69a) – Aside from programming, all publishers and authors should use git, since we have so many changing documents. Learning git, and sharing how to use it with your authors, means an end to calls from authors that their hard drive is corrupted and the manuscript changes are lost forever.


## What you’ve learned

* You have installed the tools needed to develop software on your computer.
