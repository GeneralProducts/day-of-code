      <h1>What was the 2019 Day of Code?</h1>
      <p>
        40 bookselling and publishing delegates from across the book trade, supported by ~20 coaches,
        built a real website on their laptop using free technology showcasing their own selection of book data provided by
        Nielsen. The results were showcased the following Monday at FutureBook 19, to inspire and motivate their peers. </p>

            <h2>The book industry pays too much for software</h2>
            <p>
              From bookstores to publishing houses, the book business is paying too much for software because of a lack
              of knowledge, poor technology choices, bad website briefings, and far, far too low expectations of
              technology, that cost time, reputational damage, and seemingly endless customisation fees.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>The book industry doesn’t pay enough for software</h2>
            <p>
              At the same time, we are not paying enough for software: to train knowledgeable staff, to build our own
              solutions, or to innovate with our supply chain, our consumer-facing websites, our workflow, our data
              collection, our books. Software that meets needs, saves time, and makes the sale has huge value.

            <h2>Software is eating the world</h2>
            <p>
              “Software is eating the world,” <a
                href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">said Marc Andreessen in 2011</a>,
              but the book industry hasn’t moved along far enough from our mention in his article: “Perhaps the single
              most dramatic example of this [is when] Borders agreed to hand over its online business to Amazon under
              the theory that online book sales were non-strategic and unimportant.”

        </ul>
        <cite>
          Publishing is hard to understand. Software is easier! It is so much more cost-effective to train willing book
          industry people in software than to train software people in the book industry.

          Day of Code is designed by book people, for book people, and allows you to
          learn from the people already at the intersection of publishing and technology,
          push the limits of your work productivity, and
          gain new ideas on how to incorporate technology within your own business.
