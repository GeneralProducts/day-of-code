      <h1>What is the Day of Code?</h1>
      <p>
        As one of 40 bookselling and publishing delegates from across the book trade, supported by ~15 coaches, you will build a real website on your laptop using free technology showcasing your own selection of book data that you can publish to the web and continue to develop after the workshop.
        This exclusive course, created especially for this event by publishers who code, is included in the price of your FutureBook 2019 ticket. But you must apply separately after buying your FutureBook ticket: space is strictly limited to 40 delegates.

            <h2>The book industry pays too much for software</h2>
            <p>
              From bookstores to publishing houses, the book business is paying too much for software because of a lack of knowledge, poor technology choices, bad website briefings, and far, far too low expectations of technology, that cost time, reputational damage, and seemingly endless customisation fees. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>The book industry doesn’t pay enough for software</h2>
            <p> 
              At the same time, we are not paying enough for software: to train knowledgeable staff, to build our own solutions, or to innovate with our supply chain, our consumer-facing websites, our workflow, our data collection, our books. Software that meets needs, saves time, and makes the sale has huge value.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Software is eating the world</h2>
            <p>
              “Software is eating the world,” <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">said Marc Andreessen in 2011</a>, but the book industry hasn’t moved along far enough from our mention in his article: “Perhaps the single most dramatic example of this [is when] Borders agreed to hand over its online business to Amazon under the theory that online book sales were non-strategic and unimportant.” 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <cite>
          Publishing is hard to understand. Software is easier! It is so much more cost-effective to train willing publishing people in software than to train software people in publishing.

            Day of Code is designed by publishers, for publishers, and will allow you to   
            learn from the people already at the intersection of publishing and technology,
            push the limits of your work productivity, and
            gain new ideas on how to incorporate technology within your own business.
