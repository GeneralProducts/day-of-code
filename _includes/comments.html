Well done for opening the web inspector! You can see the code for this website
at https://github.com/GeneralProducts/day-of-code

In particular, look at the .scss files, which are Sass.
https://github.com/GeneralProducts/day-of-code/blob/main/_sass/guides.scss

Sass is a CSS preprocessor extension which lets you do things such as nesting CSS and using variables.
The CSS you see in this inspector is the compiled version.
Read about Jekyll's built in support for Sass here: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/
