  This article explains how to get the starter kit. It's a large file, so please run through this article before the Day of Code so you don't have to wait for a large download on the day.
</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve written a starter kit that contains some code libraries and data that youâ€™ll need for today, which youâ€™re about to download from the code repository website GitHub. Go ahead and follow the instructions below to get started.</p>

<h2 id="download-the-files">Download the files</h2>

<p>Go to our <a href="https://github.com/GeneralProducts/publisher-website">GitHub repo</a> and click the â€œClone or downloadâ€ button, then â€œDownload ZIPâ€. This is a large ZIP file so may take some time.</p>

<h2 id="instructions-for-windows">Instructions for Windows</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In File Explorer, find the ZIP file that you have downloaded and right-mouse &gt; Expand All</li>
  <li>A dialogue box appears asking you to set the location of the unzipped folder: it should be This PC &gt; Windows (C:) &gt; Users &gt; [username] &gt; repos, so write in the repos folder name, a bit like this:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/extract-win.JPG" alt="Extracting the files on Windows" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the â€œ-masterâ€ from the end of the folder name, so it is called â€œpublisher-websiteâ€. (â€œmasterâ€ refers to the version, or branch, of the code on GitHub and is unnecessarily wordy for your local version of the code.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The folder should be located like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/win-home.JPG" alt="Correct file location on windows" /></p>

<h2 id="instructions-for-mac">Instructions for Mac</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In Finder, find the ZIP file that you have downloaded and double click to expand.</li>
  <li>Create a new folder on your computer called <code class="highlighter-rouge">repos</code>, in your home folder.</li>
  <li>Drag the unzipped folder into the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">repos</code> folder.</li>
  <li>Remove the â€œ-masterâ€ from the end of the folder name, so it is called â€œpublisher-websiteâ€. (â€œmasterâ€ refers to the version, or branch, of the code on GitHub and is unnecessarily wordy for your local version of the code.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The folder should be located in Users &gt; [username] &gt; repos &gt; publisher-website, like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/mac-home.png" alt="Correct file location on mac" /></p>

<h2 id="instructions-in-case-of-disaster">Instructions in case of disaster!</h2>

<p>If you canâ€™t download the starter kit before the Day of Code, <em>and</em> if the internet connection at our venue fails (or, more likely, if there are network and firewall issues with your computer), each coach will have the zip file as well as a copy of these instructions on a USB stick. Hopefully it wonâ€™t come to that!</p>

<h2 id="what-youve-learned">What youâ€™ve learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You have downloaded the starter kit to your computer, and youâ€™re ready for the Day of Code.</li>
</ul>
