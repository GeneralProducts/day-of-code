  This article explains the actions you will take on the Day of Code to get your starter kit. This is the first article you'll work through on the Day of Code with your coach.
</p>

<p>We’ve written a starter kit that contains some code libraries and data that you’ll need for today, which you’re about to download from the code repository website GitHub. Go ahead and follow the instructions below to get started.</p>

<h2 id="download-the-files">Download the files</h2>

<p>Go to our <a href="https://github.com/GeneralProducts/publisher-website">GitHub repo</a> and click the “Clone or download” button, then “Download ZIP”. This is a large zip file so may take some time.</p>

<h2 id="navigate-to-the-downloaded-zip-file">Navigate to the downloaded ZIP file</h2>

<p>In Finder or File Explorer, find the ZIP file that you have downloaded and double-click to unzip it, or right-mouse-unzip, or right-mouse-expand.</p>

<p>Remove the “-master” from the end of the folder name, so it is called “publisher-website”. (“master” refers to the version, or branch, of the code on GitHub and is unnecessarily wordy for your local copy.)</p>

<h2 id="move-the-unzipped-folder-to-a-repo-directory">Move the unzipped folder to a repo directory.</h2>

<p>Create a new folder on your computer called <code class="highlighter-rouge">repos</code>, in your home folder. Drag the unzipped folder into that new folder. Here’s what it should look like:</p>

<p>On Windows, the folder should be located in This PC &gt; Windows (C:) &gt; Users &gt; [username] &gt; repos &gt; publisher-website, like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/win-home.JPG" alt="Correct file location on windows" /></p>

<p>On Mac, the folder should be located in Users &gt; [username] &gt; repos &gt; publisher-website, like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/mac-home.png" alt="Correct file location on mac" /></p>

  <li>You have downloaded the starter kit to your computer, and you’re ready for the Day of Code.</li>
