  Youâ€™ll use different software to type your code, run your code, and view what your code does. This article walks through the set up actions you must do, before the Day of Code, on the laptop you'll bring with you on the day.
</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Follow the instructions <a href="http://installrails.com/">here</a> to set up Ruby and Rails on your computer, alongside some other tools youâ€™ll need. Weâ€™re not using Rails today, but this will leave your computer ready for when you want to continue on your programming adventure.</p>

<p>Following these instructions will take at least half an hour, and maybe more, so find some time to do it before the Day of Code.</p>

<h2 id="text-editor">Text editor</h2>

<p>A text editor is where you will type your code. The installation instructions prompt you to download Sublime. If you prefer another text editor such as VS Code or Atom, download that to your computer.</p>

<h2 id="command-line">Command line</h2>

<p>The command line is where you will run your code. On the Mac, the command line is called the <a href="glossary#terminal">Terminal</a>. On Windows, itâ€™s called the <a href="glossary#command-prompt">Command Prompt</a>. Either way, it is the means by which you can type instructions to your computer.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t need to install anything: these apps ship with your computer and the installation instructions introduce you to them.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you are on Mac or Windows, you will enter commands at the command line which the computer will obey. Using the command line is often a lot quicker and more reliable than using the graphical user interface of your machine: Finder on Mac or File Explorer on Windows.</p>

<h2 id="browser">Browser</h2>

<p>A browser is where you will view what your code does. We recommend the latest version of Chrome or Firefox.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://updatemybrowser.org/">Update my browser</a> and check you are using the latest version of your preferred browser. Do not use Edge or Internet Explorer: IE in particular is notoriously non-standard.</p>

<h2 id="version-control-and-backup">Version control and backup</h2>

<p>As well as saving your code on your computer, you are going to use a webservice called GitHub to store a copy of your code. You will have installed Git using the installation instructions above, but now you are going to also create a free account on GitHub. GitHub is where most programmers save and share their code, as well as having it on their computers.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">Github.com</a> and sign up for an account. Make sure you use a username and password that you will be able to recall on the Day of Code.</p>
