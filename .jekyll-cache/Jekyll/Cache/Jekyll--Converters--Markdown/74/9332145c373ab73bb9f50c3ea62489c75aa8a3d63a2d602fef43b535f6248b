  This article explains the actions you will take on the Day of Code to get your starter kit. This is the first article you'll work through on the Day of Code with your coach.
</p>

<p>We‚Äôve written a starter kit that contains some code libraries and data that you‚Äôll need for today, which you‚Äôre about to download from the code repository website GitHub. Go ahead and follow the instructions below to get started.</p>

<h2 id="download-the-files">Download the files</h2>

<p>Go to our <a href="https://github.com/GeneralProducts/publisher-website">GitHub repo</a> and click the ‚ÄúClone or download‚Äù button, then ‚ÄúDownload ZIP‚Äù. This is a large zip file so may take some time.</p>

<h2 id="navigate-to-the-downloaded-file">Navigate to the downloaded file</h2>

<p>In Finder or File Explorer, find the zip file that you have downloaded and double-click to unzip it.</p>

<h2 id="move-the-unzipped-folder-to-a-repo-directory">Move the unzipped folder to a repo directory.</h2>

<h2 id="navigate-to-your-code-folder">Navigate to your code folder</h2>

<p>Open <a href="glossary#terminal">Terminal</a> (Mac) or the <a href="glossary#command-prompt">Command Prompt</a> (Windows). You should be in your home directory. On Windows it will look something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  <span class="o">(</span>c<span class="o">)</span> 2019 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
  C:<span class="se">\U</span>sers<span class="se">\E</span>mma&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p>On the Mac it will look something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  Last login: Sat Nov 16 12:34:20 on ttys008
  Emma@Emmas-MBP-3 ~ <span class="err">$</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If the Terminal or Command Prompt does not start with your location being your home folder, you‚Äôll need to change directory into it. In that case only, at the command line, type the following and press <strong>enter</strong>:</p>

<p>On the Mac, type:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  <span class="nb">cd</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>On Windows, type:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  <span class="nb">cd</span> %HOMEPATH%</code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> stands for ‚Äúchange directory‚Äù, and it has changed the directory you‚Äôre in to your home directory starting point. You could have done the same by going to your file navigator on your computer (Finder or File Explorer) and clicking on the relevant folder, but you‚Äôre doing programming now, so you‚Äôll use the command line, which is quicker and more controllable.</p>
