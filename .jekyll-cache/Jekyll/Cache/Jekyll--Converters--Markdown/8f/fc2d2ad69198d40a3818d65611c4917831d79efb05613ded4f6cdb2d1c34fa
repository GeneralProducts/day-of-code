  This article introduces Jekyll and the templating language it uses, Liquid. You won't add anything to your code whilst reading through this article.
</p>

<p>Back when you were <a href="/get-started">getting started</a>, you bundled the Jekyll gem and started a Jekyll server.</p>

<p>In the next article, you are going to add Liquid tags to your HTML. Jekyll uses a templating language called <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a>, written in <a href="/glossary#ruby">Ruby</a>.</p>

<h2 id="liquid-tags">Liquid tags</h2>
<p>Your challenge, which youâ€™ll be walked through in the next article, is to replace the static HTML in the <em>portfolio.html</em> file with Liquid tags that will loop through all your books and display them. To do that, youâ€™ll need to know some code syntax.</p>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>Syntax means the rules about how you can use the symbols and words that make up a programming language. Use the correct syntax and the computer will know what you want it to do.</p>

<p>The syntax for tags in Jekyllâ€™s Liquid templating language is this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-liquid" data-lang="liquid">  <span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">book</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">books</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
    <span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">book</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">title</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span>
  <span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">endfor</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you want to print values onto the page in HTML, the syntax is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{</code> at the start of the command, and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">}}</code> at the end. Anything between those characters will be interpreted as a command. The code will run, and the result is printed to the screen. Youâ€™ll get a piece of data, such as the bookâ€™s title, appearing on the page.</p>

<p>If you want to run some logic but not print values onto the page in HTML, the syntax is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">{%</code> at the start of the tag, and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">%}</code> at the end. Anything between those characters will be interpreted as a Liquid command. The code will run, but the result will not be printed to the screen.</p>

<p>In a while, you are going to query your own ONIX as a data source, but for now we have prepared a bit of sample data for you to use. Go to the next article to get started in using this data source on your website, rather than typing directly into HTML.</p>

<h2 id="what-youve-learned">What youâ€™ve learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The web browser on your computer requests a web page from a remote server. That server sends back an HTML file, plus some CSS. Your browser uses the CSS to lay out that HTML so that you can see the web page properly displayed on your screen. Thatâ€™s how the internet works.</li>
  <li>You are using Jekyll, a static site generator, which uses a templating language called Liquid.</li>
  <li>Jekyllâ€™s Liquid language uses command tags to produce HTML.</li>
</ul>
