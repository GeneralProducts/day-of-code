  This article suggests some next steps for the end of the day or for your ongoing journey after the Day of Code.
</p>

<p>Well, you‚Äôve done it! You‚Äôve built a website. Has the bug bitten you? It‚Äôs normal at this stage to feel overwhelmed, tired, brain dead and possibly a bit weepy. You‚Äôve had a tantalising, whistle-stop tour of a brand new set of concepts, and you might have a feeling of both elation ‚Äì you did it! ‚Äì and also an awareness that there is a lot to learn in programming.</p>

<p>Once you‚Äôve got over today, it would be great to use today as a jumping-off point for your next coding adventure.</p>

<h2 id="save-your-code-on-github">Save your code on GitHub</h2>

<p>Before the Day of Code, you created an account on GitHub. <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Follow the instructions here</a> to upload your code to your free account.</p>

<h2 id="publish-your-website-to-the-internet">Publish your website to the internet</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/">Follow the instructions here</a> to publish your website to a free hosting provider called Netlify. <a href="https://publisher-website.netlify.com/">Here‚Äôs one we made earlier</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-the-learn-more-boxes-for-ideas">Use the Learn More boxes for ideas</h2>

<p>Throughout today you will have seen callout boxes headed ‚ÄúLearn more later‚Äù and sections called ‚ÄúDo more later‚Äù. It‚Äôs a great idea to go back through these docs, at your leisure, and explore those ideas further.</p>

<h2 id="introverts-route">Introverts‚Äô route</h2>
<p>If you are an introvert, you‚Äôre most likely to enjoy learning over the internet, from books and from videos. We recommend <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough</a> as a great place to get started, followed by <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a> and <a href="http://railstutorial.org">The Rails Tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2 id="extroverts-route">Extroverts‚Äô route</h2>
<p>If you prefer learning alongside other people, then <a href="https://codebar.io/">Codebar</a> is a great and welcoming event that happens frequently in London, with a new chapter opened in Oxford. <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Railsgirls</a> is also another good taster day and the Consonance team volunteer there. <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>, <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a> and <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon</a> run crash courses, but they‚Äôre not cheap.</p>

<h2 id="coding-in-publishing">Coding in publishing</h2>
<p>How can you start to apply what you‚Äôve learned today?
The JSON data that you used today is a good example of structured book data. The same sort of structured approach can be found in ONIX, which is the XML standard that the book trade uses to share metadata. You could explore ONIX XML as well as JSON. You could extend the functionality of the app that you‚Äôve written today to present more of the information accessible from the JSON to improve your website as a selling or reader discovery tool. You could find that you want to learn more about Ruby, and web development frameworks, and write your own dynamic websites.</p>

<p>Whichever way your interests take you, the more knowledge you accrue, the more power you have. Any step towards demystifying code gives you power in third party relationships, on any digital project. You might find that the bug really bites you and that you want to delve deeper into programming ‚Äì but any technical knowledge improves your position. You don‚Äôt need to be a professional programmer, but programming knowledge will make you a wiser project manager, editor, marketer, designer and reader advocate. You will know what‚Äôs possible.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs more code to extend the functionality of your mug on <a href="https://github.com/generalproducts/mug">GitHub</a>. Intrigued? Go and have a look, and see if you can glug your beverage of choice from your mug, programmatically!</p>
