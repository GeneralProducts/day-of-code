          <strong>Day of Code</strong> works by having small groups of delegates following detailed technical guides, supported by friendly coaches who feel knowledgeable enough to be pretty confident on the command line, able to read documentation and field questions from delegates. We're excited that our coaches include some of the most prominent and enthusiastic publisher-programmers in the book trade today. And if you'd like to join them, that's great: enthusiasm and interest is the most important prerequisite for being a coach. What else do you need?

        <h2>What do I need to be a coach?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-item">Patience, willingness to help, and a friendly attitude</li>
            <li class="list-item">Adherence to our <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a></li>
            <li class="list-item">Being confident enough to field all sorts of questions in a beginner-friendly way throughout the duration of the workshop, bearing in mind that sitting and Googling together is a great way to show how most programming works! You're not meant to know everything; your role is to provide insights into how to find things out</li>
            <li class="list-item">Experience with web development helps, but any programming experience will be great</li>
            <li class="list-item">Some time to go through the tutorial before the event.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What will I get from being a coach?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="list-item">Free entry to the main FutureBook conference on November 25th 2019, worth ~Â£500</li>
          <li class="list-item">A coach's t-shirt, printed with your brand logo if desired</li>
          <li class="list-item">Lunch!</li>
          <li class="list-item">Networking with 40 publisher and bookselling delegates at Day of Code, and key representatives from the whole industry at FutureBook</li>
          <li class="list-item">Day of Code is a non-profit event, with the main sponsors providing their time and resources for free. Sadly that means we cannot cover travel expenses and there is no fee</li>
          <li class="list-item">Knowledge and CV points for helping to inspire a generation of publishers to code. Imagine what they'll build: you'll have helped them get started.</li>

        </ul>
